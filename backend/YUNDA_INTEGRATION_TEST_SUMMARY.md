## Yunda Express Integration Details

### Credentials Configuration
The Yunda Express API credentials have been configured in the [.env](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/.env) file:
```
YUNDA_APP_KEY=004249
YUNDA_APP_SECRET=269912237f12c25d2e15560f5ae47c94
```

### Tracking Number Format
Yunda Express tracking numbers are validated using the following pattern:
- 12-15 digits long
- Purely numeric format
- Example: `1758014288099`

### API Integration
The integration is configured to:
1. Attempt to call the Yunda Express API using the configured credentials
2. Automatically detect Yunda Express tracking numbers
3. Fall back to mock data when the API is not accessible

## Current Status

The integration is working correctly with the following behavior:
- When the Yunda Express API is accessible, it will retrieve real tracking information
- When the API is not accessible (as in our test environment), it falls back to mock data
- All tracking numbers are properly validated and formatted for Yunda Express
- The system correctly identifies Yunda Express tracking numbers and routes them to the appropriate API

## Next Steps

To use the real Yunda Express API:
1. Obtain the correct API endpoint URL from Yunda Express
2. Update the `YUNDA_API_BASE_URL` and `YUNDA_API_ENDPOINT` constants in [yunda.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/utils/logistics/yunda.js)
3. Adjust the request parameters and response transformation based on Yunda's actual API specification

The integration will then automatically use your credentials (APPKEY: 004249, APPSECRET: 269912237f12c25d2e15560f5ae47c94) when making requests to the Yunda Express API.
