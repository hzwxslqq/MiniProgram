# Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. API Endpoint Mismatch
**Problem**: The frontend was calling `/api/login` but the backend had the endpoint at `/api/auth/login`
**Solution**: 
- Updated [utils/api.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/utils/api.js) to use correct endpoints
- Updated [pages/login/login.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/pages/login/login.js) to use the API utility functions

### 2. Password Hash Issue
**Problem**: The default admin user password hash in the database was incorrect
**Solution**:
- Generated a new correct hash for password "admin123"
- Updated [backend/utils/db.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/utils/db.js) with the correct hash
- Created scripts to verify the fix

### 3. Route Configuration Verification
**Problem**: Initial testing showed 404 errors for API endpoints
**Solution**:
- Verified that routes were correctly configured in [backend/server.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/server.js)
- Confirmed that all routes are properly mounted
