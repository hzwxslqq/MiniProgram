# Fixes Summary

## Issue
The order interface was displaying messy and repetitive information instead of proper order details like order number, quantities, etc.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by inconsistent data structure handling between the backend API responses and the frontend display components. The data transformation logic in the frontend was not properly handling the different data structures returned by the file-based and MySQL database implementations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Orders Page (`pages/orders/orders.js`)
- Enhanced data transformation logic to handle both file-based and MySQL database structures
- Added proper fallback handling for missing fields
- Ensured consistent field naming (camelCase) regardless of database backend
- Improved error handling and fallback to sample data on API failures

### 2. Frontend Order Detail Page (`pages/orders/detail/detail.js`)
- Added similar data transformation logic to handle different data structures
- Implemented proper field mapping for consistent display
- Added status text mapping for better user experience

### 3. Backend Controllers
- Updated both file-based (`backend/controllers/orderController.js`) and MySQL (`backend/controllers/mysql/ordersController.js`) order controllers to return consistent data structures
- Ensured proper field naming conventions in API responses
- Improved error handling and response formatting

### 4. Backend Models
- Updated the file-based Order model (`backend/models/Order.js`) to handle both camelCase and snake_case field names
- Improved data consistency between different database implementations

## Key Improvements
1. **Consistent Data Structure**: Both database implementations now return data in a consistent format
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Better fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
3. **Field Mapping**: Proper mapping of database fields (snake_case) to frontend fields (camelCase)
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear status text display and proper order information presentation

## Testing
The fix has been tested with both file-based and MySQL database implementations to ensure consistent behavior across both backends. The test script `test-frontend-order-display.js` verifies that the data transformation logic works correctly with different data structures.

## Files Modified
- `pages/orders/orders.js` - Main orders list page
- `pages/orders/detail/detail.js` - Order detail page
- `backend/controllers/orderController.js` - File-based order controller
- `backend/controllers/mysql/ordersController.js` - MySQL order controller
- `backend/models/Order.js` - File-based order model

## Verification
The test script confirms that the data transformation logic correctly handles:
- Mixed field naming conventions (snake_case and camelCase)
- Different data structures from various database backends
- Missing fields with appropriate fallbacks
- Proper status text mapping
- Date formatting for display
