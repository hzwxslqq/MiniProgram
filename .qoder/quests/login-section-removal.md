## Overview

This document outlines the design for two changes to the MimiProgram WeChat Mini-Program:
1. Remove the registration section from the login interface
2. Fix the payment cancellation functionality

## 1. Login Section Removal

### Current Implementation
The login page currently includes a registration link at the bottom:
```xml
<view class="register-link">
  <text>Don't have an account? </text>
  <text class="register-text" bindtap="onRegister">Register</text>
</view>
```

However, there is no actual registration page implementation in the project. The REGISTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md document describes a planned registration feature, but the pages/register/ directory and files do not exist, and there is no registration page entry in app.json.

### Proposed Changes
Remove the registration link section from the login page since:
1. There is no actual registration page implementation
2. The user requested removal of this functionality

### Files to Modify
- `pages/login/login.wxml` - Remove the registration link section

### Implementation Plan
Remove the following code block from `pages/login/login.wxml`:
```xml
    <view class="register-link">
      <text>Don't have an account? </text>
      <text class="register-text" bindtap="onRegister">Register</text>
    </view>
```

No JavaScript changes are required since there is no `onRegister` function implemented in `pages/login/login.js`.

## 2. Payment Cancellation Issue Analysis and Fix

### Current Implementation
The payment page has a cancellation function:
```javascript
onCancel: function() {
  wx.showModal({
    title: 'Cancel Payment',
    content: 'Are you sure you want to cancel the payment? You can complete it later from the orders page.',
    success: (res) => {
      if (res.confirm) {
        wx.navigateBack();
      }
    }
  });
}
```

### Issue Analysis
The cancellation functionality appears to be correctly implemented. However, there might be a few potential issues:

1. **Navigation Context**: `wx.navigateBack()` only works if there is a previous page in the navigation stack. If the payment page was opened with `wx.redirectTo()` or `wx.reLaunch()`, there might be no page to navigate back to.

2. **Modal Response Handling**: The success callback only handles the `confirm` case but doesn't handle the `cancel` case explicitly.

3. **Disabled State**: The cancel button has a disabled state when `paymentProcessing` is true, which is correct, but might prevent cancellation during processing.

### Proposed Solution
Improve the cancellation function to handle all edge cases:

1. **Enhanced Navigation Handling**: Check if navigation back is possible, and if not, redirect to a default page (like home)
2. **Explicit Cancel Handling**: Handle both confirm and cancel responses from the modal
3. **Improved User Feedback**: Provide better feedback during the cancellation process

### Files to Modify
- `pages/payment/payment.js` - Update the `onCancel` function

### Implementation Plan
Replace the current `onCancel` function with:

```javascript
onCancel: function() {
  wx.showModal({
    title: 'Cancel Payment',
    content: 'Are you sure you want to cancel the payment? You can complete it later from the orders page.',
    success: (res) => {
      if (res.confirm) {
        // Try to navigate back
        const pages = getCurrentPages();
        if (pages.length > 1) {
          // There are pages in the stack, navigate back
          wx.navigateBack();
        } else {
          // No pages in stack, redirect to orders page
          wx.redirectTo({
            url: '/pages/orders/orders'
          });
        }
      }
      // If res.cancel, do nothing (modal will close automatically)
    },
    fail: (err) => {
      console.error('Modal failed:', err);
      // Fallback navigation
      wx.navigateBack({
        fail: () => {
          // If navigateBack fails, go to orders page
          wx.redirectTo({
            url: '/pages/orders/orders',
            fail: () => {
              // If all else fails, go to home tab
              wx.switchTab({
                url: '/pages/home/home'
              });
            }
          });
        }
      });
    }
  });
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Login Section Removal

**File to modify:** `pages/login/login.wxml`

**Change:** Remove the following lines:
```xml
    <view class="register-link">
      <text>Don't have an account? </text>
      <text class="register-text" bindtap="onRegister">Register</text>
    </view>
```

This section should be removed from within the `<view class="login-container">` element, which will result in the final lines of the file looking like this:
```xml
    <view class="instruction-text">
      <text>Tapping above will prompt for profile access. Please allow access to login with your WeChat profile.</text>
    </view>
  </view>
</view>
```

### 2. Payment Cancellation Fix

**File to modify:** `pages/payment/payment.js`

**Change:** Replace the existing `onCancel` function with the improved implementation:
```javascript
  // Cancel payment and go back
  onCancel: function() {
    wx.showModal({
      title: 'Cancel Payment',
      content: 'Are you sure you want to cancel the payment? You can complete it later from the orders page.',
      success: (res) => {
        if (res.confirm) {
          // Try to navigate back
          const pages = getCurrentPages();
          if (pages.length > 1) {
            // There are pages in the stack, navigate back
            wx.navigateBack();
          } else {
            // No pages in stack, redirect to orders page
            wx.redirectTo({
              url: '/pages/orders/orders'
            });
          }
        }
        // If res.cancel, do nothing (modal will close automatically)
      },
      fail: (err) => {
        console.error('Modal failed:', err);
        // Fallback navigation
        wx.navigateBack({
          fail: () => {
            // If navigateBack fails, go to orders page
            wx.redirectTo({
              url: '/pages/orders/orders',
              fail: () => {
                // If all else fails, go to home tab
                wx.switchTab({
                  url: '/pages/home/home'
                });
              }
            });
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
```

## Testing Plan

### Login Section Removal
1. Open the login page in the WeChat Developer Tool
2. Verify that the registration link is no longer visible
3. Confirm that the page layout remains visually balanced

### Payment Cancellation Fix
1. Navigate to the payment page from the normal flow (cart -> checkout -> payment)
2. Test the cancel button and confirm navigation back to the previous page
3. Test edge case where payment page might be opened directly (simulate with redirect)
4. Verify that the modal appears correctly and handles both confirm and cancel actions
5. Test error scenarios where navigation might fail

## Security Considerations

No security implications for either change:
- Removing UI elements doesn't affect backend security
- The enhanced cancellation function only improves navigation reliability

## Performance Impact

Negligible performance impact:
- Removing UI elements slightly reduces page complexity
- The enhanced cancellation function adds minimal overhead with proper error handling
