# Address Management Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the address pre-configuration and enhanced Buy Now functionality for the MimiProgram e-commerce system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Address Management System
- **Backend Model**: Created [UserAddress](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/models/UserAddress.js#L3-L89) model for storing user addresses in the database
- **Backend Controller**: Created [addressController](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/controllers/addressController.js#L3-L191) with full CRUD operations for user addresses
- **Backend Routes**: Created [address routes](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/routes/address.js#L1-L31) for the new API endpoints
- **Database Schema**: Updated database initialization to include [userAddresses](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/utils/db.js#L366-L375) collection

### 2. API Endpoints
The following endpoints were implemented:
- `GET /api/user/addresses` - Retrieve all addresses for current user
- `POST /api/user/addresses` - Create a new address
- `PUT /api/user/addresses/:id` - Update an existing address
- `DELETE /api/user/addresses/:id` - Delete an address
- `PUT /api/user/addresses/:id/default` - Set an address as default

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- **Address Management Page**: Created a new page at [/pages/addresses](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/pages/addresses/) with full CRUD functionality
- **Checkout Integration**: Modified the checkout page to support address selection from saved addresses
- **Buy Now Enhancement**: Updated the Buy Now function to use the user's default address when available
- **Navigation Links**: Added links to the address management page from the orders and checkout pages

### 4. API Integration
- **Frontend API Methods**: Added address management methods to [utils/api.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/utils/api.js#L1-L247)
- **Backend Server**: Updated [server.js](file:///c%3A/02WorkSpace/SourceCode/MimiProgram/backend/server.js#L1-L92) to include the new address routes

## Key Features

### Address Management
- Users can save multiple shipping addresses
- Addresses are associated with user accounts
- Users can set a default address
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Default address handling

### Checkout Enhancement
