# Payment Interface Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Order Number Not Generated
**Problem**: Order numbers were not displaying correctly in the payment interface.
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data structure handling between backend API responses and frontend display.
**Solution**: Enhanced data transformation logic to properly map order number fields from both file-based and MySQL database implementations.

### 2. Quantity Unit Display Issues
**Problem**: Quantity units were showing garbled or incorrect text.
**Root Cause**: Incorrect data binding in the WXML template and inconsistent field naming.
**Solution**: Fixed data binding in the template and ensured proper field mapping in the JavaScript logic.

### 3. Unclear Shipping Information Display
**Problem**: Confusion about what shipping information should be displayed.
**Solution**: Clarified the display to show shipping fee as a monetary value in the order summary section.

### 4. Incorrect Total Amount
**Problem**: Total amount was not calculating or displaying correctly.
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data structure and missing decimal formatting.
**Solution**: Implemented proper data transformation and added `.toFixed(2)` formatting for monetary values.

## Key Changes Made

### Payment Page JavaScript (`pages/payment/payment.js`)
- Enhanced `loadOrderDetails` method with robust data transformation logic
- Added proper field mapping for order numbers, item details, and monetary values
- Improved error handling and data consistency checks

### Payment Page Template (`pages/payment/payment.wxml`)
- Fixed data binding for order number, item quantities, and prices
- Added proper decimal formatting for monetary values using `.toFixed(2)`
- Improved item display structure with clear separation of price and quantity
- Removed debugging elements and simplified the UI

### Order Detail Page Template (`pages/orders/detail/detail.wxml`)
- Applied consistent formatting and data binding improvements
- Added decimal formatting for all monetary values
- Improved item display structure

## Technical Improvements

1. **Consistent Data Structure Handling**: Both file-based and MySQL database implementations now return data in a consistent format
2. **Field Mapping**: Proper mapping of database fields (snake_case) to frontend fields (camelCase)
3. **Decimal Formatting**: All monetary values now display with exactly 2 decimal places
4. **Error Resilience**: Better handling of missing or inconsistent data fields
5. **User Experience**: Clearer display of order information with proper formatting

## Testing
The fixes have been tested with both file-based and MySQL database implementations to ensure consistent behavior across both backends.
